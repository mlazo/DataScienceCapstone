It breaks up the phrase you type in into words. The sequence of words is called an n-gram. Two words\nform a bigram, 3 form a trigram, etc. The application then uses an N-Gram back off model to predict the next word. \nThe way the model was built is this: First data from news, twitter and blogs were loaded and cleaned. Then a sample of the data was extracted. I used 2% of \nthe original data. The data is broken up into 1-grams, bi-grams, tri-grams and quad-grams. For each of these n-gram samples the frequency of each ngram is calculated. The \nn-grams are then sorted from the most frequent to the least frequent occurences. That means that the sequence of n words that appears the most frequently among \nall sets of n words from all of the data appears at the top of the list.\n\nNow, assuming you have entered a phrase of 3 or more words the phrase that you have entered is cleaned up (removes apostrophes, numbers, punctuation and turned into lower case)\nbroken up into a sequence of words and the results are compared to the quadgrams. If the phrase is found in the first three words of a quadgram the next\nword that is predicted is the final word of the quadgram. If that fails, or if you entered a phrase that is only two words long, the same process is repeated using the final two words\nof your phrase and comparing them to the first two words of a trigram. Again, if successful, the next word predicted would be the last word of the trigram.\nIf that fails, or if you have only entered one word a similar process is used. \nFinally, if all else fails, the most frequently occuring single word in the set of initial documents is presented as the predicted next word\"\n))\n)\n)\n))\n\n\n",
